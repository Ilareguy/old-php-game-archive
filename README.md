A small online game I designed when I first started learning PHP, MySQL, HTML, etc.

The visual design would probably make your eyes bleed so I refrained from posting screenshots here :-).
Keep in mind that this was written when I first started learning PHP and other web technologies in 2010 so the code is pretty bad.

Over the years I ended up losing the SQL backup file so everything database-wise is lost.
